Program tested on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS
gcc version 4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5)

"ExecutionLoop.cpp" has a variable named PROCESSORS that can be
changed if you would like to test with more or less processors.


Compiling
---------
Simply use "make" for the base program. If you would like to
run the version that uses malloc, type "make malloc"

Running
-------
"./MemoryTest" is all that's needed.

Clean Up
--------
We made it easy with "make clean"
